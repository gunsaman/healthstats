# JS_ES_Features

A PDF listing the features/topics needed for the JavaScript exam 
(That is an exam before starting to look at React/Redux/Node etc.) 

There are also some code trials testing several tricky features of JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8, ...) that are used in Node backends and React/Redux frontends.

Clone the repo, open the index.html and read the instructions
